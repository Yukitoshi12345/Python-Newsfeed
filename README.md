Step 1: In the root directory of your python-newsfeed project, run the following command:

```
python -m venv venv
```

The python -m venv uses Python's built-in venv module to create a new directory. In this case, the new directory is also called venv. The venv directory holds all the files that make a virtual environment possible.
